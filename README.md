For the UR5 robot:

- Do research on its sound model;
- Check the specifications of the joints and choose compatible random efforts (forces or torques);
- Implement dynamic equations through a script (python, matlab, lua...);
- Apply efforts directly to the joints and monitor the positions of the links;
- Compare with the results obtained by applying the same efforts to the model simulated by a simulator of your choice.

Deliver a technical report or video demonstrating the main results.
